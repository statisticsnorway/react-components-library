# dc-react-components-library
DC React Components Library

###How this library was created
- Created by create-react-app
- Added Rollup for bundling the code and babel for transpiling JSX into native javacript.

### How to use this library in another React application directly from GitHub (useful in early development)
1. In your React application run `yarn add https://github.com/statisticsnorway/dc-react-components-library.git` 
    * Optionally add `#name-of-branch` at the end to use a specific branch instead of master
